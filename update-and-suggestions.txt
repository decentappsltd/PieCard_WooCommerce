To ensure that the plugin code works correctly with your website and the Pi eCard platform, you need to perform the following modifications:

+ Is there a way we can retrieve their provided webhook url then replace the 'woocommerce_api_complete' action with the correct webhook URL provided by the Pi eCard platform. The webhook URL needs to be registered with the Pi eCard dashboard.

+ Update the plugin's icon URL to a valid URL for your website.

+ Ensure that you have the correct clientid, clientsecret, and accesstoken values from your Pi eCard account. Update the plugin's private_key, publishable_key, and access_token options with these values since they will be provided, we can retrieve and update it.

+ Make sure that the PHP version of your website is compatible with the plugin's requirements.

The suggestions below could be achieved by a demo app;
+ Install and activate the WooCommerce plugin on your website.

+ Install and activate the Pi eCard for WooCommerce plugin on your website.

+ We can test the plugin by making a test transaction using the Pi eCard sandbox mode.

+ Once you we have verified that the plugin works correctly, we can switch to live mode by updating the testmode option to 'no' in the plugin's settings.

        ***** LOCALLY *****
  *
  *
  *
      + Install and set up a local development environment such as XAMPP(I used this back then and it was way convinient, don't if there's a better one now), WAMP, or MAMP.
      + Add the following lines of code at the end of the (pi-ecard-woocommerce.php) file:

                $gateway = new WC_PieCard_Gateway();
                $order_id = 123; // Replace this with an actual order ID from the store.
                $gateway->process_payment($order_id);

      + Save the file and open it in your web browser by navigating to "http://localhost/pi-ecard-woocommerce.php".
      + If there are any errors, you will see them on the page. If not, the code has executed successfully, and the payment gateway should be added to WooCommerce.
      
      Note: Replace the $order_id variable with an actual order ID from a store to test the payment process. Also, make sure that the Pi eCard API credentials are correct and that the webhook is set up correctly.

          To test the plugin in the WooCommerce environment and check if it can make a transaction from within WordPress, we can follow the steps below:

          + Install WooCommerce: If we haven't already installed WooCommerce on our WordPress site (that's why i asked if we have a demo site already), we need to do that first. We can install WooCommerce like any other WordPress plugin from the WordPress plugin repository.

          + Install our plugin: Is our plugin live on the WordPress plugin repo? If so we should install it or by upload the plugin files to our WordPress installation.

          + Activate the plugin: After installing our plugin, activate it by going to the WordPress Dashboard > Plugins and clicking the 'Activate' button for our plugin.

          + Configure the plugin: If the plugin has any settings, configure them according to your needs (I think this should be all the keys and data required).

          + Add test products: Create some test products in WooCommerce that we can use to test the transaction functionality of our plugin.

          + Test the plugin: Add the test products to the cart and go through the checkout process to see if the plugin is capable of making a transaction.

          + Debugging: If the transaction fails or there are any errors. Check the logs, console or developer tools for any error messages.

          By following these steps, we should be able to make a transaction from within WordPress.

        * I think this steps should be the WooCommerce integrating our plugin as a payment method.
        *
        *
        *
          + Install and activate our plugin on your WooCommerce website.

          + In the WordPress dashboard, go to WooCommerce > Settings > Payments and find the Pi eCard payment gateway.

          + Enable the Pi eCard payment gateway and enter the required details for testing (such as the sandbox mode, public key, private key, and access token). Make sure to save your changes.

          + Create a test product in a WooCommerce store and add it to your cart.

          + Proceed to checkout and select the Pi eCard payment method.

          + Complete the checkout process, and it should be redirected to the Pi eCard payment page.

          + Then in the Pi eCard payment page, use test details to complete the payment (these are usually provided by the payment gateway).

          + After completing the payment, it should be redirected back to the WooCommerce store, and the order status should be updated accordingly (probably handelde by the client).

      * Verify that the payment was processed correctly and that the order details are correct.

If everything looks good, disable the sandbox mode/testmode and enter your live account details to start accepting real payments.





        /********************************************     CONNECTING DATABASE TO SITE   ***********************************************/

        To connect a MySQL database to your WordPress site, follow these steps:

        1. Log in to the WordPress site's admin dashboard.

        2. Click on "Plugins" in the left-hand menu and then click on "Add New."

        3. In the search bar, type "MySQL" and hit Enter.

        4. Install and activate the "WPDB SpringClean" plugin. This plugin cleans up the database and optimizes it for better performance.

        5. Go to the WordPress site's 'wp-config.php' file. This file can be found in the root directory of the WordPress installation.

        6. Add the following lines of code to the 'wp-config.php' file, replacing "database_name_here," "username_here," and "password_here" with the actual name of the database, MySQL username, and MySQL password:

                        ```
                        define('DB_NAME', 'database_name_here');
                        define('DB_USER', 'username_here');
                        define('DB_PASSWORD', 'password_here');
                        define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
                        define('DB_CHARSET', 'utf8mb4');
                        define('DB_COLLATE', ''); // You can leave this as is
                        ```

        7. Save the wp-config.php file.

        The WordPress site should now be connected to the MySQL database. If you encounter any issues, double-check that you have entered the correct database name, username, and password, and that the MySQL server is running properly, otherwise do let me know.
