To ensure that the plugin code works correctly with your website and the Pi eCard platform, you need to perform the following modifications:

+ Is there a way we can retrive their provided webhook url then replace the 'woocommerce_api_complete' action with the correct webhook URL provided by the Pi eCard platform. The webhook URL needs to be registered with the Pi eCard dashboard.

+ Update the plugin's icon URL to a valid URL for your website.

+ Ensure that you have the correct clientid, clientsecret, and accesstoken values from your Pi eCard account. Update the plugin's private_key, publishable_key, and access_token options with these values since they will be provided, we can retrive and update it2.

+ Make sure that the PHP version of your website is compatible with the plugin's requirements.
